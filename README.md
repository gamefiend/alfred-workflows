# alfred-workflows
This a collection of my Alfred Workflows. Maybe some of them are useful for you as well!

## Quickclone 
Quickly clone a pasted URL from github into a directory you specify, and notifies you if there are problems.

**Requirements:**

`git` 

**Usage:**

- place the directory you want to clone to in the git_home workflow variable.

- From the github page for the repo, copy the URL from the 'Clone or Download' button, then activate Alfred.

- in Alfred, type 'clone <URL>' (paste repo URL here). Alfred will open Terminal, clone the repo, then notify you when it finishes.
